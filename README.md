# n-Gram Algorithm Implementation

## Overview

This repository focuses on the implementation of the n-gram algorithm, an essential technique in natural language processing (NLP) and computational linguistics. The n-gram model predicts the occurrence of a word based on the previous 'n' words in a sequence of text, often used in various text-related applications such as language modeling, speech recognition, and spelling correction.

## Source Paper: Real-World Trajectory Sharing with Local Differential Privacy

The primary reference paper for the n-gram algorithm implementation is titled "Real-World Trajectory Sharing with Local Differential Privacy" authored by Teddy Cunningham, Graham Cormode, Hakan Ferhatosmanoglu, and Divesh Srivastava. Published in the Proceedings of the VLDB Endowment (PVLDB) in 2021 (Volume 14, Issue 11), the paper introduces a local differentially private mechanism based on perturbing hierarchically-structured, overlapping n-grams of trajectory data. The DOI for the paper is [10.14778/3476249.3476280](https://doi.org/10.14778/3476249.3476280).
